# roblox-fps-unlocker-batch-file
It's a batch file that limits the FPS to 300 instead of Roblox's default limit of 60 FPS. It's a program that you must run only every time Roblox updates, you run it once and that's it, you don't need to have anything else running in the background that consumes resources.
